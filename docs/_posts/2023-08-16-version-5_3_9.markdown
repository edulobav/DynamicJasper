New version released 5.3.9

* Support for JasperReports 6.20.1+ (to 6.20.4 as of time of writing).
At the time of writing, JR 6.20.5 is available, but it has [this bug](https://community.jaspersoft.com/jasperreports-library/issues/3127-0) (https://community.jaspersoft.com/jasperreports-library/issues/3127-0) which affects
the layout of sub-reports heavily. If you don't use sub-reports, it is safe to use JR 6.20.5
* Removed support to WebWork and Struts2 as part of the main core. Maybe adding it as a separated artifact
